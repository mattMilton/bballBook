          <h3>Selecting Players</h3>
          <p>When selecting a player from any page, whether answering a query or other reason, 
            you must hit the button that their number resides in. 
          </p>
          <h3>Auto-start and Auto-stop of Time</h3>
          <p>We have removed the auto-start/auto-stop feature until we have fully inplemented run-time options.
            Otherwise, in run-time games, the clock being stopped when in event pages results in more time correcting
            once back in the game page. If you are scoring a game that does have stop-time, you should stop the clock
            manually when the whistle is blown, then go into the event page. Then remember to start the clock when play
            resumes. Try to train yourself that any time you hear a whistle, there is a good chance you need to either 
            start or stop the clock.

            <h2>Game Settings Page</h2>
            <h3>Team Foul Limits</h3>
            <p>In the two lines, Team Fouls to Bonus and Team Fouls to Penalty you specify what 
              type of free throws will be shot at which team foul numbers. If the game you are 
              scoring uses one-and-one only at a certain team foul number, enter the number in 
              the Team Fouls to Bonus line, and enter 0 in Team Fouls to Pentaly line. If, 
              on the other hand, the game only uses shooting two after a certain foul limit, enter
              the number of fouls needed to shoot two in the Team Fouls to Penalty line, and 0 
              in Team Fouls to Bonus line. If the game you are scoring uses both limits (like
              college basketball, 7 and 10), enter numbers in both lines, but the Fouls to Bonus
              number must be less than Fouls to Penalty. At least one of the two lines must have 
              a number greater than zero. 
            </p>
            <h3>Timeouts</h3>
            <p>This line is the number of timeouts each team gets per game. If the game you are scoring
              allows each team a certain number per period, you may want to set this number high, and then record
              fake timeouts at half or ends of periods to make the number displayed on the scoreboard more accurate
              towards the end of the game. More fine-grained customization of timeouts is being considered for future versions.
            </p>
            <h3>Teams</h3>
            <p>Each team must have at least 5 players before game can begin. If a team does not have 5 players but 
              the officials are still allowing the game to begin, we recommend filling the roster with numbers only,
              and preferrably numbers that will not be used. You can even use numbers such as 100 to make it clear that
              it is not really a player. Then if/when players show up, you can edit that player from within the game page
              by clicking on the fake number and turning it into a real player. Or, just add a new player. Editing the 
              fake player to a real player will result in an inaccurate minute count if the fake player was considered on
              the court during the game. 
            </p>
            <h2>Edit Team Page</h2>
            <p>This is where you will name teams and add or remove players. You may add players by ony entering their 
              number, or their number and name. The first five players entered will be considered the starters. If you
              do not enter the starters first, you will just have to substitute the starters in before starting the game
              once you get to the game page. There is nothing wrong with doing it this way, it just saves a little time 
              and keeps the mock substitutions off of the Plays log. 
            </p>
            <h2>Game Page</h2>
            <p>The Game Page has three sections, the scoreboard, the rosters and the plays.</p>
            <h2>Scoreboard</h2>
            <p>The scoreboard and the event buttons directly below it are where almost all events are initiatied.</p>
            <h3>Time Control</h3>
            <p>
              You can edit the time and period with the up/down buttons above and below the time and on the side
              of the period. You would usually only do this to sync up the clock (if it got off by a few seconds), 
              or to enter an event that had previously been missed. You start and stop the clock by clicking on 
              the time itself.
            </p>
            <h3>Timeouts and Jump Balls</h3>
            <p>To record a timeout, you click on corresponding team's TOL number on the scoreboard. To record a 
              jump ball, click on the word POSS on the scoreboard. Erroneously entering either of these events is 
              easily fixed by deleting the event from the play log. 
            </p>
            <h2>Event Buttons</h2>
            <p>Click any of the seven event buttons to initiate corresponding event. They are almost all 
              very self-explanatory. All details of the event will be recorded by answering questions in the 
              resulting page. 
            </p>
            <h3>Offensive Fouls and And-1's</h3>
            <p>To record an offensive foul, go into Turnover page. In the page you will be asked
              whether the turnover was an offensive foul.</p>
            <p>If a player makes a shot and is fouled, do 
              not enter into Made FG page. There is nowhere in Made FG page to report that player was
              fouled while shooting. Instead, enter Foul page. In the Foul page, you will be able to 
              respond that the player was fouled while shooting, and that the player made the shot. 
            </p>
            <h3>Rebounds</h3>
            <p>Some events, missed field goals and missing last free throw, result in a rebound. If no player
              gets the rebound, it should be credited to the team that is rewarded possession. 
            </p>
            <h2>Rosters Section</h2>
            <p>The rosters/players section of the game page shows which players are on the court at any
              given time and all players basic stats. Clicking on any players number opens up that players
              details where you can edit the player, substitute the player in or out, and see their detailed
              stats. 
            </p>
            <h3>Add Player</h3>
            <p>If a player arrives late, or was missed when initially entering players, use button at bottom of 
              the roster to add a player after game as been initiated. Same as in Game Settings, player must 
              have a number, but name is optional. 
            </p>
            <h2>Plays Log</h2>
            <p>All events in plays log are deletable or switchable except period start and finish messages. 
              The tip-offs are switchable, which sets the control of the tip to the opposite team. Any subsequent 
              jump balls and period starts will then also be corrected as a result of changing tip-off control.
            </p>
            <h3>Deleting Fouls</h3>
            <p>You may delete a foul in the play log, if it is improperly recorded. The system will correct
              the player and team foul count for all subsequent fouls. But, the system does not remove free
              throws that resulted from the foul being deleted, or any subsequent fouls that resulted in free 
              throws. Therefore, you must remove resulting free throws if necessary. This way you are able to 
              change something about a recorded foul (assister, fouler, etc.) without changing resulting free throws
              in the event that the play did happen, but it wasn't recorded accurately. In a nutshell, be aware that
              deleting free throws does not delete free throws, but you may do that manually.  
            </p>
            <h2>Foul Page</h2>
            <h3>Shooting Foul?</h3>
            <p>After selecting who committed the foul, the page asks if it was a shooting foul. This is only
              asking if the foul was committed in the act of shooting, not if free throws will result. The 
              system will determine if free throws will result due to team fouls. 
            </p>
            <h2>Free Throws Page</h2>
            <h3>Defensive Lane Violation</h3>
            <p>If defensive player enters the lane early, but free throw is made, ignore the 
              violation, count the free throw as made. If free throw is missed, you should also
              ignore the violation, as these violations are not tracked statistics. Use the resulting
              substitute free throw in place of the free throw that is cancelled due to the violation.
            </p>
            <h3>Offensive Lane Violation</h3>
            <p>If any offensive player, including the shooter, commits a violation by entering the lane too early,
              remove the play from the plays log. Then enter a turnover and charge it to the player who committed 
              the violation.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Free Throw Doesn't Hit the Rim</h3>
            <p>If a final free throw does not hit the rim, it is a missed free throw and a violation. Since the violation
              is not a tracked statistic, you can ignore the violation and count the free throw as missed. Unfortunately, 
              you must select a rebounder in this scenario. Count it as a defensive team rebound. We are looking into 
              fixing this discrepancy for a future version. 
            </p>
            <h2>Player Page</h2>
            <h3>Substituting</h3>
            <p>Select player to substitute the player for. Then hit Confirm and not Back to Game. 
              Back to Game will not process the substitution.
            </p>
            <h3>Detail Stats</h3>
            <p>Statistics are always the cumulation of all stats recorded, regardless of time on clock. 
              This means, even if you change from third period back to first, stats will show all three
              periods, not just the first. This is also true of stats in Players section of Game Page.
            </p>
